;; embark - Emacs Mini-Buffer Actions Rooted in Keymaps.

;; This package provides a command `embark-act' (and a variant
;; `embark-act-noexit') to execute actions on the top minibuffer
;; completion canidate: the one that would be chosen by
;; minibuffer-force-complete.  Additionally `embark-act' can act on
;; the completion candidate at point in the completions buffer. You
;; should bind both of them in `minibuffer-local-completion-map' and
;; also bind `embark-act' in `completion-list-mode-map'.

;; The actions are arranged into keymaps separated by the type of
;; completion currently taking place.  By default `embark' recognizes
;; the following types of completion: file names, buffers and symbols.
;; The classification is configurable, see the variable
;; `embark-classifiers'.

;; For any given type there is a corresponding keymap as noted in
;; `embark-keymap-alist'.  For example, for the completion category
;; `file', by default the corresponding keymap is `embark-file-map'.
;; In this keymap you can bind normal commands you might want to use
;; on file names.  For example, by default `embark-file-map' binds
;; `delete-file' to "d", `rename-file' to "r" and `copy-file' to "c".

;; The default keymaps that come with `embark' all set
;; `embark-general-map' as their parent, so that the actions bound
;; there are available no matter what type of completion you are in
;; the middle of.  By default this includes bindings to save the
;; current candidate in the kill ring and to insert the current
;; candidate in the previously selected buffer (the buffer that was
;; current when you executed a command that opened up the minibuffer).

;; You can use any command that reads from the minibuffer as an action
;; and the target of the action will be inserted at the first
;; minibuffer prompt.  You don't even have to bind a command in one of
;; the keymaps listed in `embark-keymap-alist' to use it!  After
;; running `embark-act' all of your keybindings and even
;; `execute-extended-command' can be used to run a command.

;; By default, for most commands `embark' inserts the target of the
;; action into the next minibuffer prompt and "presses RET" for you,
;; accepting the target as is.  You can add commands for which you
;; want the chance to edit the target before acting upon it to the
;; list `embark-allow-edit-commands'.

;; If you want the default to be to allowing editing the target for
;; all commands, set `embark-allow-edit-default' to t and list
;; exceptions in `embark-skip-edit-commands'.

;; If you want to customize what happens after the target is inserted
;; at the minibuffer prompt of an action, you can use the global
;; `embark-setup-hook' or override it in the `embark-setup-overrides'
;; alist.  See the default value of `embark-setup-overrides' for an
;; example.

;; You can also write your own commands that do not read from the
;; minibuffer but act on the current target anyway: just use the
;; `embark-target' function (exactly once!: it "self-destructs") to
;; retrieve the current target.  See the definitions of
;; `embark-insert' or `embark-save' for examples.

;; If you wish to see a reminder of which actions are available, I
;; recommend installing which-key and using `which-key-mode' with the
;; `which-key-show-transient-maps' variable set to t.
