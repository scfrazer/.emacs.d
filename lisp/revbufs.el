;;; Commentary:

;; `revbufs' is a little package I wrote for situations in which both humans
;; and compilers directly modify the same files.  After running `make' to have
;; the tool modify the files, I do `M-x revbufs RET' to update all my buffers.
;;
;; `revbufs' won't revert a buffer that has been modified (what it calls
;; "conflicts"), and will tell you if any files disappeared out from under your
;; buffers ("orphans").

;;; Change Log:

;; [Version 1.0, 04-Sep-1999, nwv@acm.org] Initial release.
